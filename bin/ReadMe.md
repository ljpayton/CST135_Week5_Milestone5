# Hutto & Payton Vending Machine 

The goal for Week 5:

(Lyric) Implement Inventory Management class: the inventory and stock reduces by 1, upon canceling the purchased item restock's by 1, additional interaction in connection with the vending machine.

(James)Implement an animation class upon each item selection is dramatically falls in the cart. in addition, the visual changes match the functionality of the project.


## Things that need to be fixed:

When you run this program the products are not going to deduct from the inventory because they are not connected.However, you can manually update the quantity by double click and changing the number and pressing enter. 

Hopefully week six we have enough time to work together to fix this codes because it is very disconnected at this point.
